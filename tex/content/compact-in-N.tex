\section{Compactness for fixed \(\lambda\)}

\begin{theorem}
  For fixed \(\lambda > 0\), \(\Set{ \lawmu^{\lambda, N} }_{N\in\bN} \subset \cP(D_{\cP(\potspace)}[0,T])\) is relatively compact.
  % \begin{equation}
  %     \operatorname{Law}(\mu^{\lambda, N}) = \lawmu^{\lambda, N} \wto \bar{\lawmu} \in \mathcal{P}(D_{\mathcal{P}(\potspace)}[0,T])
  % \end{equation}
  % as \(N\to\infty\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  By Prokhorov's Theorem \cite[Theorem 5.1]{billingsleyConvergenceProbabilityMeasures1999}, it suffices to show that \(\Set{ \lawmu^{\lambda, N} }_{N\in\bN}\) is tight.
  Recall that \(\lawmu^{\lambda, N}\) is the law of the empirical measure process \(\mu^{\lambda, N}\).
  Because \((\cP(\potspace), \pi)\) is a (complete, separable) metric space with \(\pi\) the standard Prokhorov metric that metrizes weak convergence \cite[Theorem 6.8]{billingsleyConvergenceProbabilityMeasures1999}, Corollary 21 of Kouritzin \cite{kouritzinTightnessProbabilityMeasures2015} tells us that it suffices to show that the compact containment condition (CCC) and the weak modulus of continuity condition (WMCC) hold.

  To verify the CCC we have to show that
  \begin{equation}
    \forall \eps > 0 : \exists \cK_\eps \Subset \cP(\potspace) :
    \inf_{N\in\bN} P^{\lambda, N} (\mu_t^{\lambda, N} \in \cK_\eps,\ 0 \leq t \leq T) \geq 1 - \eps.
  \end{equation}
  Let \(\eps > 0\), and simply define
  \begin{equation}
    \cK_\eps \coloneqq \Set{ \mu_t^{\lambda, N} \given t \in [0,T],\  }
  \end{equation}

  % As \(\potspace\) is compact, complete and separable, \(\cP(\potspace)\) is compact w.r.t. the weak topology by Prokhorov's Theorem.
  % Therefore, it is clear that the family of processes \(\{\mu^{\lambda, N}\}_{N\in\bN} \subset \cP(\potspace)\) satisfies CCC.

  \bigskip

  To verify that the WMCC holds, we define the following collection of functions on \(\cP(\potspace)\):
  \begin{equation}
    \cG \coloneqq \Set{\nu \mapsto \int_\potspace \psi \odif{\nu} \given \psi \in C^1(\potspace) \cap C_0(\potspace)}.
  \end{equation}
  Because we are using the topology of weak convergence on \(\cP(\potspace)\), it follows from \(C^1(\potspace) \cap C_0(\potspace) \subset C_b(\potspace)\) that \(\cG \subset C(\cP(\potspace))\).
  Furthermore, \(\cG\) is closed under addition and it separates points (on compacts).

  Let \(g = g_\psi \in \cG\).
  It now suffices to show that \(\{g \circ \mu^{\lambda, N}\}_{N\in\bN}\) satisfies the asymptotic modulus of continuity condition (AMCC).
  Let \(\eta > 0\).
  % By taking \(\mathcal{J} \coloneqq \{\Id\} \subset C_b(\cP(\potspace))\), which clearly strongly separates points, in Proposition 14 b)
  Let \(N_0 \in \bN\) such that \(\Exp{}{[M_T^{\lambda, N}]} < \), which is possible by \zcref{prop:vanishing-variance}, and let \(N \geq N_0\).
  Now observe that
  \begin{equation}
    g \circ \mu^{\lambda, N} = \int_\potspace \psi \odif{\mu^{\lambda, N}} = S^{\lambda, N} = M^{\lambda, N} - A^{\lambda, N}.
  \end{equation}
  It follows that for \(C_\lambda^\psi \coloneqq \norm{b}_\infty \norm{\partial_x \psi}_\infty + 2\lambda \norm{\psi}_\infty\) (such that \(\widehat{L}^{\lambda,N}_t [\psi] (x) \leq C_\lambda^\psi\) for all \(t\), \(x\)) and \(\delta \coloneqq \frac{1}{2C_\lambda^\psi}\) and a \(\delta\)-sparse partition \(\{t_i\}\) such that \(t_i - t_{i-1} < \frac{1}{C_\lambda^\psi}\), we have
  \begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
      P^{\lambda, N} (w'(g \circ \mu^{\lambda, N}, \delta) \geq \eta)
       & \leq P^{\lambda, N}( \max_i w(M^{\lambda, N}, [t_{i-1}, t_i)) + w(A^{\lambda, N}, [t_{i-1}, t_i) \geq \eta)                                     \\
       & \leq P^{\lambda, N}( \max_i w(M^{\lambda, N}, [t_{i-1}, t_i)) \geq \frac{\eta}{2}) + P^{\lambda, N}(w(A^{\lambda, N}, [t_{i-1}, t_i) \geq \eta)
    \end{split}
  \end{equation}


  % Since for any \(\psi \in C_b(\potspace)\),
  % \begin{equation}
  %     \sup_{N\in\bN} \Exp{}{ \sup_{t\in[0,T]} \abs{ \int_\potspace \psi \odif{\mu_t^{\lambda,N}} } } \leq \norm{\psi}_{\infty},
  % \end{equation}
  % it suffices to show by the Aldous-Rebolledo criterion that both the martingale part and bounded variation part of \(S_t\) have tight laws.
  % For stopping times \(0 \leq S \leq S' \leq S + \delta \leq T\), we have
  % \begin{equation}
  %     \Exp{}{ \widehat{M}_{S'}^{\lambda,N} - \widehat{M}_{S}^{\lambda,N} }
  %     \overset{\text{(CS)}}{\leq} \Exp{}{ \abs{ \widehat{M}_{S'}^{\lambda,N} - \widehat{M}_{S}^{\lambda,N} }^2 }^{1/2}
  %     \leq \Exp{}{\sbr{\widehat{M}^{\lambda,N}}_{S+\delta} - \sbr{\widehat{M}^{\lambda,N}}_{S}}^{1/2}
  %     \overset{N\to\infty}{\to} 0
  % \end{equation}
  % by \zcref{prop:before}.
  % The bounded variation part \(A_{S'} - A_S\) also clearly goes to zero for \(\delta \downarrow 0\).
\end{proof}
