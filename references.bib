We analyse several aspects of the NNLIF model: the number of steady states, a priori estimates, blow-up issues and convergence toward equilibrium in the linear case. In particular, for excitatory networks, blow-up always occurs for initial data concentrated close to the firing potential. These results show how critical is the balance between noise and excitatory/inhibitory interactions to the connectivity parameter.},

Such an equation is intended to describe an infinite population of neurons which interact with one another. Each time a proportion of neurons ‘spike’, the whole network instantaneously receives an excitatory kick. The instantaneous nature of the excitation makes the system singular and prevents the application of standard results from the literature. Making use of the Skorohod M1 topology, we prove that, for the right notion of a ‘physical’ solution, the nonlinear equation can be approximated either by a finite particle system or by a delayed equation. As a by-product, we obtain the existence of ‘synchronized’ solutions, for which a macroscopic proportion of neurons may spike at the same time.},

Building on the previous work of [13, 1, 14] and [9] we establish for a large class of networks of Hopfield-like neurons, i.e. rate neurons, the mean-field equations on a time interval [0, T ], T {$>$} 0, of the thermodynamic limit of these networks, i.e. the limit when the number of neurons goes to infinity. Unlike all previous work, except [9], we do not assume that the synaptic weights describing the connections between the neurons are i.i.d. as zero-mean Gaussians. The limit equations are stochastic and very simply described in terms of two functions, a “correlation” function noted KQ(t, s) and a “mean” function noted mQ(t). The “noise” part of the equations is a linear function of the Brownian motion, which is obtained by solving a Volterra equation of the second kind whose resolving kernel is expressed as a function of KQ. We give a constructive proof of the uniqueness of the limit equations. We use the corresponding algorithm for an effective computation of the functions KQ and mQ, given the weights distribution. Several numerical experiments are reported.},

  abstract = {Among various rare events, the effective computation of transition paths connecting metastable states in a stochastic model is an important problem. This paper proposes a stochastic optimal control formulation for transition path problems in an infinite time horizon for Markov jump processes on polish space. An unbounded terminal cost at a stopping time and a controlled transition rate for the jump process regulate the transition from one metastable state to another. The running cost is taken as an entropy form of the control velocity, in contrast to the quadratic form for diffusion processes. Using the Girsanov transformation for Markov jump processes, the optimal control problem in both finite time and infinite time horizon with stopping time fit into one framework: the optimal change of measures in the C`adla`g path space via minimizing their relative entropy. We prove that the committor function, solved from the backward equation with appropriate boundary conditions, yields an explicit formula for the optimal path measure and the associated optimal control for the transition path problem. The unbounded terminal cost leads to a singular transition rate (unbounded control velocity), for which, the Gamma convergence technique is applied to pass the limit for a regularized optimal path measure. The limiting path measure is proved to solve a Martingale problem with an optimally controlled transition rate and the associated optimal control is given by Doob-h transformation. The resulting optimally controlled process can realize the transitions almost surely.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering works of Lapicque [17] and of Hodgkin and Huxley [16], several types of models have been addressed to describe the evolution in time of the potential of the membrane of a neuron. In this note, we investigate a connected version of N neurons obeying the leaky integrate and fire model, previously introduced in [1–3,6,7,15,18,19,22]. As a main feature, neurons interact with one another in a mean field instantaneous way. Due to the instantaneity of the interactions, singularities may emerge in a finite time. For instance, the solution of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation describing the collective behavior of the potentials of the neurons in the limit N → ∞ may degenerate and cease to exist in any standard sense after a finite time. Here we focus out on a variant of this model when the interactions between the neurons are also subjected to random synaptic weights. As a typical instance, we address the case when the connection graph is the realization of an Erdo¨s-Renyi graph. After a brief introduction of the model, we collect several theoretical results on the behavior of the solution. In a last step, we provide an algorithm for simulating a network of this type with a possibly large value of N .},

  abstract = {The fact that the solution of a martingale problem for a diffusion process gives a weak solution of the corresponding Itˆo equation is well-known since the original work of Stroock and Varadhan. The result is typically proved by constructing the driving Brownian motion from the solution of the martingale problem and perhaps an auxiliary Brownian motion. This constructive approach is much more challenging for more general Markov processes where one would be required to construct a Poisson random measure from the sample paths of the solution of the martingale problem. A “soft” approach to this equivalence is presented here which begins with a joint martingale problem for the solution of the desired stochastic equation and the driving processes and applies a Markov mapping theorem to show that any solution of the original martingale problem corresponds to a solution of the joint martingale problem. These results coupled with earlier results on the equivalence of forward equations and martingale problems show that the three standard approaches to specifying Markov processes (stochastic equations, martingale problems, and forward equations) are, under very general conditions, equivalent in the sense that existence and/or uniqueness of one implies existence and/or uniqueness for the other two.},

This, together with a chapter on continuous time Markov chains, provides the motivation for the general setup based on semigroups and generators. Chapters on stochastic calculus and probabilistic potential theory give an introduction to some of the key areas of application of Brownian motion and its relatives. A chapter on interacting particle systems treats a more recently developed class of Markov processes that have as their origin problems in physics and biology."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {In the mean field integrate-and-fire model, the dynamics of a typical neuron within a large network is modeled as a diffusion-jump stochastic process whose jump takes place once the voltage reaches a threshold. In this work the main goal is to establish the convergence relationship between a regularized process and the original one where in the regularized process, the jump mechanism is replaced by a Poisson dynamic, and jump intensity within the classically forbidden domain goes to infinity as the regularization parameter vanishes. On the macroscopic level, the Fokker-Planck equation for the process with random discharges (i.e. Poisson jumps) is defined on the whole space, while the equation for the limit process is defined on the half space. However, using an iteration scheme the difficulty due to the domain differences has been greatly mitigated and the convergence for the stochastic process and the firing rates can be established. Moreover, we find polynomial-order convergence for the distribution by a re-normalization argument in probability theory. Finally, using numerical experiments we quantitatively explore the rate and the asymptotic behavior of convergence for both linear and nonlinear models.},
