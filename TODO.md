## Introduction
- [ ] Write one

## Preliminaries
- [ ] Possibly change to Skorokhod space on $[0,T]$ instead of $[0,\infty]$.
- [ ] Add the Kouritzin results I end up using.
- [ ] Jusitfy the martingale problem's connection with SDE's.

## Model
- [ ] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Get solution existence for drift for non-Dirac i.c., using what Oliver said about conditional distributions
- [ ] Check on elaborate on solution existence theorem for full generator mainly
- [ ] Upgrade to unique solution (low-prio)

## Connection to empirical measure
- [ ]  Go through Overleaf comments

## Vanishing variance
- [ ] Go through Overleaf comments, and the proof ;(

## Compactness for fixed $\lambda$
- [ ] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Finish result
