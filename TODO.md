-## Introduction
- [ ] Write one

## Preliminaries
- [ ] Possibly change to Skorokhod space on $[0,T]$ instead of $[0,\infty)$. If not, make the notation for the $\sigma$-algebra non-ambiguous (as it currently does not distinguish between $[0,T]$ and $[0,\infty)$).
- [ ] Add Arz√®la-Ascoli for comparison
- [ ] Add the Kouritzin result(s) I end up using.
- [ ] Jusitfy the martingale problem's connection with SDE's.

## Model
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Get solution existence for drift for non-Dirac i.c., using what Oliver said about conditional distributions
- [ ] Check / elaborate on solution existence theorem (proof), for full generator mainly
- [ ] Upgrade to unique solution for all martingale problems (low-prio)

## Connection to empirical measure
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [x] Rewrite
- [ ] It would be cleaner to prove that the claimed domain for Theta_N is correct, instead of showing that the emp measure is cadlag
- [ ] Also in that proof, there is a zcref problem as it writes Theorem instead of Definition

## Vanishing variance
- [ ] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Rewrite / update

## Compactness for fixed $\lambda$
- [ ] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Finish result
- [ ] Say something about the consequences of the convergence (see meeting notes)
