## Notation
- [ ] Choose between $\infty$ and $+\infty$.

## Introduction
- [ ] Come up with a title
- [ ] Write one

## Preliminaries
- [ ] Possibly change to Skorokhod space on $[0,T]$ instead of $[0,\infty)$.
    - [ ] If not, make the notation for the $\sigma$-algebra non-ambiguous (as it currently does not distinguish between $[0,T]$ and $[0,\infty)$).
    - [ ] And clarify that w'(x,delta) := w'(x,delta,T).
- [ ] Add Arz√®la-Ascoli for comparison
- [x] Add the specific Kouritzin result(s) I end up using.
    - [ ] Figure out the reason for indistinguishability in Theorem 20 in Kouritzin.
- [x] Add some stochastic calculus background
- [ ] Justify the martingale problem's connection with SDEs.
- [x] Change to $s-$ in the martingale problem integrand (and update subsequent sections accordingly)

## Model
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [ ] Get solution existence for drift for non-Dirac initial conditions, using conditional distributions probably
- [ ] Check / elaborate on solution existence theorem (proof), for full generator mainly
- [ ] Upgrade to unique solution for the martingale problems (EK Th. 4.10.3?)

## Connection to empirical measure
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [x] Rewrite
- [x] It would be cleaner to prove that the claimed domain for Theta_N is correct, instead of showing that the emp measure is cadlag
- [x] Also in that proof, there is a zcref problem as it writes Theorem instead of Definition

## Vanishing variance
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [x] Rewrite / update

## Compactness for fixed $\lambda$
- [x] Go through Overleaf comments
- [x] Finish result
- [ ] Say something about the consequences of the convergence / whether the limit point also satisfies the MP (see meeting notes)
